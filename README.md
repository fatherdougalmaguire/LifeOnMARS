LifeOnMARS  is a Core Wars environment written in Swift/SwiftUI

I'm aiming for a fully compliant ISCW 94 MARS virtual machine as well as IDE, Debugger, Hill functionality and Warrior evolution capability

And at some point along the way,  it will be ported to Windows, Linux and Microbee

Why ?

Because it seems interesting and I wanted to dive into the world of GUI coding
